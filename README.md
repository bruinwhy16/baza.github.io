BAZA Engineering Solutions created an affordable, fully mechatronic vinyl-record cleaner designed by UW–Seattle Mechanical Engineering students, using a stepper motor, a DC motor, a 3D-printed arm, an ESP32 dev kit, and microfiber cloths. The system ensures reliable cleaning through precise motion control and durable components.
